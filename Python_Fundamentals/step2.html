        <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (<em><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code></em> and  <em><code>â€¦</code></em>): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p>
<p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the hash character, <em><code>#</code></em>, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="py"># this is the first comment
spam = 1  # and this is the second comment`
          # ... and now a third!
text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."
</code></pre>
